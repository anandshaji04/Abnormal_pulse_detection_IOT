Here are the instructions for setting up the hardware:

Hardware Setup:
1. Connect Heart Rate Sensor Module to Arduino: Use male-to-female jumper wires to make the following connections:
   - Connect the output pin of the heart rate sensor module to pin 2 of the Arduino.
   - Connect the VCC pin of the heart rate sensor module to the 5V pin of the Arduino.
   - Connect the GND pin of the heart rate sensor module to the GND pin of the Arduino.

Once these connections are made, the hardware setup is complete. You can move on to setting up the software and cloud services.

Software Setup:
1. Install Arduino IDE: Download and install the Arduino IDE from the official website (https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) for your operating system.
2. Upload Arduino Code: Open the Arduino IDE, copy the provided Arduino code (Arduino_Code.ino) into a new sketch, and upload it to your Arduino board.
3. Set up Email Automation: Create an account on Mailgun (https://www.mailgun.com) and verify your phone number. Add a recipient email in the Domains section and generate sandbox credentials.
4. Set up SMS Service: Sign up on Twilio (https://www.twilio.com), enable SMS services, and obtain your Account SID, Auth token, and phone number.
5. Run Python Code: Use a DigitalOcean VPS or a dedicated Linux computer to run the provided Python code (Python_Code.py) for processing data, detecting abnormalities, and sending email and SMS alerts.

Once the software setup is complete, you can proceed with testing the system.

Linux Commands you would require:

sudo apt-get -y update
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install boltiot
sudo nano confi.py
sudo nano confi.py
